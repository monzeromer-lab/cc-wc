# Coding Challenge 1 - Build your own wc! by JOHN CRICKETT

This repository contains an implementation of the Unix `wc` command line tool, written in Rust. This project is a part of my journey to learn more about Rust and Unix system programming.

## About `wc`

The `wc` (word count) command in Unix/Linux operating systems is used to find out number of newline count, word count, byte and characters count in a files specified by the file arguments.

## About this Implementation

This version of `wc` is implemented in Rust, a language that I'm currently learning. I chose Rust because of its emphasis on performance, memory safety, concurrency, and I'm still learning it.

## Features

- Counts lines, words, and characters in a file
- Fast and efficient

## Usage

```bash
cc-wc -- filename
```

## Note:

I'm on windows so probably there's no support for standard input.
